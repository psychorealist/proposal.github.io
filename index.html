        <div class="mainText">Introduction:
            For the final project of DART 449,  I have chosen to go with a narrative based website that goes around telling an interactive fictional story. The story is centered around the several topics including stress, anxiety, nightlife/ rave scene, and aspects of substance use (not abuse or the glorification of the use of certain mind altering substance). The theme of the story is centered around the idea of ‘Glitch’ both metaphorically and literally. The glitch will take the user through a cyberpunk-esque aesthetic that including literal glitching and lines of command prompt codes that will take the user through the story as if the brain was a machine. At the forefront of the narrative, the main line of communication will be through literal text that will tell the story along side small pieces of poetry that will act as reflection of what the main characters thoughts are in a secluded manner to that would be more understandable when the main narrative described literally in the first-person perspective of the main character.

        <div class="mainText">Background/Inspiration:  
            Over the past two years since I’ve moved to Montreal I have found myself lucky enough to have become part of Montreals rave scene, both underground and commercial. What started off as my personal intrigue in alternative ways of life grew to encompass mine in a lot of ways. Starting in my first summer here, I had gotten the chance to start going to some of these parties that went on till  much later than bars and club stay open. Instead of 3am these events don’t conclude until hours as late as 6,7, or 8 in the morning sometimes going even further on. Simultaneously I had began to VJ (video jockey) for some friends at small shows and bars for DJ sets, eventually this grew into a full time freelance job starting off having regular nights every weekend at a club in the old-port which served as a place for me to practice and experiment, which then grew to making big visual installations at events at the raves that I had fell in love with and later at bigger Montreal institutions  such as the Phi center and the SAT. I had gone to being an attendee at these events to becoming part of them. Today you will see my artist name “Giotto” on multiple flyers each weekend doing live visuals and multi media installations. I had become a staring visual artist in a scene obviously dominated by music and by no little sacrifice. Tackling both being a full-time student and working a fairly physically and mentally taxing freelance job takes its toll. Some nights are methodical and easy, others take days of preparation, pre-planing, hours of setting up, and hours of tearing down after the event. Some nights, I am in the both running the visuals live as a performance that is intertwined with the music. Other nights I set up an installation and I am free to enjoy the event from start to finish. Of course given the setting comes the advent of mind altering substance use that add another dimension to the experience. When being in such a scene becomes your life, it is the setting where you see many of your friends and create some of the fondest memories and some of the most stressful and anxiety driven ones. It is where you cry, bleed, laugh, and fall in love. When it is your life, your day becomes the night, you become nocturne incarnate, you become the night. At some point much like your regular day, it all starts to blend into each other only with the intensity of the grand substance induced euphoria. Thematically in my practice, I’ve always included the prospect of distortion, both literally and figuratively. The glitch distorts the video or 3d objects in the visuals, it mangels the videos of feed back looped performance artist until they are barely recognizable, just so that if you looked hard enough in a trans induced state you begin to see it and become part of it. All these experience create a fog of distortion bringing up questions of sanity. How did you feel? Why did you feel? Was I just high or was it real? Despite the questionable nature of these substance, one thing will always be true about them, it will always show you a reflection of your psyche. Nothing is created in a void, not even you thoughts, sober or otherwise. 
        For this project I would like to tell a version of this story, a fictional version at that. One inspired by my own experiences and the experiences of others.

        <div class="mainText">Website (Aesthetics and functions):
            The website I wish to create will encompass the function of telling the story as a narrative. It will be a well rounded audio visual experience that will include correlating audio functions and visual functions that go along with the story.  The main function will include a scroll function to advance through different parts of the story and possibly some page transition at different sections of the story. The aesthetics will be heavily inspired by cyberpunk-esque (the genre and the game) glitch mania, text-based adventures, and command prompts. I would like to use lots of css animation functions to bring the command prompt elements to life as if they were being executed or typed out. Also to lean heavily on these aesthetics, using high contrasting colors and a Monospaced typeface. I would like to possibly explore the use of some Web Gl functions to further the functions and interactivity of the website. I will also be using video elements, both based in render animations, live video, or a combination of the two. This will mostly consist of the glitchy and distorted visuals that may include flashing lights and intense transitions.

        <div class="mainText">Website (the story):
            The story will follow an individual going to a rave. It will follow their first person experiences with friends and a their lover and the psychic journey that they go through as they think about their life and their previous experiences that I have gone through. The story will establish some conflict that the main character will experience, mostly in their head. The conflict will center around the relationship with their lover and with their relationship with intimacy. They (much like my own story) have a vast majority of their life centered around the night and so a theme will also include the rising of the sun as dawn comes and the sight of the sun makes things a bit clearer. Alongside the telling of the story will lines of poetry that will act as metaphors for the way the character is feeling and what is going through their head. The concept of the glitch as a metaphor for the fogginess of the brain and when something cannot comprehend or understand happens (much like a computer glitching). Through out aspects of mental health will be also expanded upon such as anxiety and depression, and its effects on the character through out the telling of the story. </div>
